Instead of scaring villagers away like he used to, a reluctant Shrek now agrees to autograph pitchforks. Longing for the days when he felt like a \\\"real ogre\\\", Shrek is tricked into signing a pact with the smooth-talking dealmaker Rumpelstiltskin. He agrees to trade a day from his childhood in exchange for a day to exist as a real ogre again. However, Shrek suddenly finds himself in a twisted, alternate reality where ogres are hunted, Rumplestiltskin is king, Puss is obese, and Shrek has never met Donkey or Fiona. Shrek discovers he unknowingly traded the day he was born and will not exist after the day is over.Shrek becomes entangled with an underground resistance of ogres led by Fiona. Rumpelstiltskin places a bounty on Shrek's capture, offering the \\\"deal of a lifetime\\\" as a reward. The Pied Piper captures most of the resistance excluding Shrek and Fiona. Shrek, unable to win Fiona's affection, turns himself in and offers to trade his life to free the captured ogres. The recently released ogres go back to free Shrek and Fiona. As the twenty-four hours are almost up and Shrek lies dying, Fiona kisses him, breaking the deal and reverting everything back to normal. After finding himself back at his triplets' birthday party where he previously lost his temper and stormed out, he joyfully reunites with family and friends realizing he has everything he ever wanted.\",\n                \"duration\": 93,\n                \"image\": \"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/38/12/94/381294c14aab4be8aeac07448a0efa46.jpg\"\n            },\n            \"hallId\": {\n                \"id\": 10\n            },\n            \"time\": \"2020-09-28T19:39:21\",\n            \"price\": 33.33\n        },\n        \"name\": \"Jacqueline\",\n        \"surname\": \"Hubbard\",\n        \"email\": \"faucibus@idblandit.co.uk\"\n    },\n    \"seatId\": {\n        \"id\": 57,\n        \"hallId\": {\n            \"id\": 2\n        },\n        \"row\": 7,\n        \"column\": 1\n    },\n    \"discount\": \"SENIOR\"\n}",
